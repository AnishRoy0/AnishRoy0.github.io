                                Raising a child as a single parent often comes with unique challenges, including managing responsibilities, balancing work and caregiving, and navigating emotional well-being. A supportive platform can help single parents feel less isolated, share resources, and gain strength from a community that understands their journey.

                                This mission is personal. When I was in pre-elementary school in South Korea, my close friend, (for privacy reasons I will call her Sally) Sally's father passed away unexpectedly, leaving her and her family to navigate life-altering challenges alone. Witnessing this highlighted the immense difficulties single parents endure, raising children while coping with grief and responsibilities.

                                During the COVID-19 pandemic, these challenges became widespread. Globally, over 10.5 million children lost a parent or caregiver by May 2022, including 5.2 million orphaned children, most of them adolescents. In the U.S., over 140,000 children lost a parent or primary caregiver between April 2020 and June 2021—approximately 1 in every 500 children—with minority communities disproportionately affected.

                                Even before the pandemic, single-parent households were common. As of 2023, around 25% of U.S. children lived with a single parent, and 4% lived with neither parent, highlighting the scale of single-parent and orphaned households. Tragic events such as the Air India Flight 171 crash further leave families devastated, sometimes creating single-parent households or leaving grandparents as the sole caregivers.

                                These experiences and statistics demonstrate how urgent support systems are for families navigating life-altering circumstances. This platform aims to provide a safe space where single parents and guardians can access community, encouragement, and practical resources, ensuring no parent—or child—faces these challenges alone.
